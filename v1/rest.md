# Crude Cards - Protocol v1 _(Draft)_

1. Responses must be JSON.
2. ðŸ”’ indicates that an endpoint requires a valid `authorization` header. If this header is invalid or not present, the server should respond with the code 401.
3. `?` indicates that a parameter is optional.
4. All rate-limits provided in this specification are _suggested_ - you can change them if you wish.
5. Provided rate-limits are in the format `limit/time - mode`, where `time` is the time in seconds, e.g. 5/60 means 5 requests per minute. If `mode` is `token`, then the rate-limits should be applied by the `authorization` header and not the IP address.

-----
## Default Responses
### 401 - Invalid Authorization
For endpoints that require authorization and invalid authorization is given:
```js
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Authorization required."
}
```

### 404 - Resource Not Found
If applicable, use an endpoint's specific 404 response, otherwise respond with the following JSON and error code 404:
```js
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Resource not found."
}
```

### 429 - Rate-limiting
To rate-limit an endpoint, make sure the following headers are present:

#### Headers
- `X-RateLimit-Limit` - number of requests allowed in the current window.
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` - number of requests remaining in the current window.
- `X-RateLimit-Reset` - The remaining window before the rate limit resets (in UTC epoch seconds.)
- `Retry-After` - Time remaining (milliseconds) until the current window resets (used to minify time offsets.)

#### Response (429)
```js
{
  "code": 429,
  "message": "You are being rate-limited.",
  "meta": { // the meta field is optional, but if provided it MUST contain these properties.
    "limit": 0,
    "remaining": 0,
    "reset": 0,
    "retryAfter": 10
  }
}
```
