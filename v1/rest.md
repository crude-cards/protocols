# Crude Cards - Protocol v1 _(Draft)_
See also: [Gateway](gateway.md) and [Structures](structures.md)

## REST API

1. Responses must be JSON.
2. ðŸ”’ indicates that an endpoint requires a valid `authorization` header. If this header is invalid or not present, the server should respond with the code 401.
3. (ðŸ”’) indicates that authorization may not always be required (see endpoints for specific information.)
4. `?` indicates that a parameter is optional.
5. All rate-limits provided in this specification are _suggested_ - you can change them if you wish.
6. Provided rate-limits are in the format `limit/time - mode`, where `time` is the time in seconds, e.g. 5/60 means 5 requests per minute. If `mode` is `token`, then the rate-limits should be applied by the `authorization` header and not the IP address.
7. All requests made to the server will use HTTPS.
8. Mentioned structures, e.g. _"User object"_, can be found in the structures documentation (link provided above)

-----
## Default Responses
### 401 - Invalid Authorization
For endpoints that require authorization and invalid authorization is given:
```js
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Authorization required."
}
```

### 404 - Resource Not Found
If applicable, use an endpoint's specific 404 response, otherwise respond with the following JSON and error code 404:
```js
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Resource not found."
}
```

### 429 - Rate-limiting
To rate-limit an endpoint, make sure the following headers are present:

#### Headers
- `X-RateLimit-Limit` - number of requests allowed in the current window.
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` - number of requests remaining in the current window.
- `X-RateLimit-Reset` - The remaining window before the rate limit resets (in UTC epoch seconds.)
- `Retry-After` - Time remaining (milliseconds) until the current window resets (used to minify time offsets.)

#### Response (429)
```js
{
  "code": 429,
  "message": "You are being rate-limited.",
  "meta": { // the meta field is optional, but if provided it MUST contain these properties.
    "limit": 0,
    "remaining": 0,
    "reset": 0,
    "retryAfter": 10
  }
}
```
